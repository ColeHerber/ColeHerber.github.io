### **Working Model**

That looks fantastic, but can it actually release it?

Yes, yes it can!(Sorry for the rap music)

### **Suction Cup Testing**

Simple proof of concept in a bucket. Amazing that it looks like it just works! Simple pressure applied from a reasonable sized suction cup, and it's good! Having multiple bellows was super important, ensuring that we could have a good amount of freedom from our attack angle is pivotable on a submarine with so many degrees of freedom.

### **Suction Cone**

Here's the actual magic, a funnel with gaps on the side creates a really simple but crude venturi system. This allows water to be pulled it, and then pushed out in limited quantities, forcing a pressure difference to occur and the system to work! For simplicity and with the limited time frame, the cone was 3d printed. A plastic pneumatic hose was connected using a press on fitting. To have a solid seal on the fitting attachment, hot glue and heat shrink were used in conjuction.

### **Arm**

To actualy reach the objects for this years challenge, we have to go around some lovely rails. The easy fix for this is to have the arm be attached to a 4 bar linkagage and lower itself, while maintaining the entire object parallel the entire time. Using some lovely carbon fiber tubes, 3d prints, and nylon bearings, The system works great!
